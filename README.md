# Overview
social mesh is a social network that's supposed to work in a similar fashion to email.
for example when you want to read your email you can use your client to download your emails from a server,
and for portability reasons there are standrds that govern how you can interact or even change your host alltogether
without losing your content which would make cesorship pretty deficult,
because as soon as your host bans you, you can just either change it and upload your pre-existing content there or host it on your own server.
combine that with a 0 password login that utilizes asymetric cryptography for proof of identity and you've got yourself a fully anonymouse censorship free network.
now this doesn't mean there won't be ways for you to identify yourself if you wanted to or moderate your server/network
for instance there will be an association server that will govern the identity of the users on your network
which would allow you to moderate your network and build profiles for your users if you so please.
